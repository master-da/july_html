**Any Body Can Help**

"Any Body Can Help" is a charity website that is designed using HTML and CSS. The basic motto of this website is to collect the volunteers to provide basic education to every child deprived of it due to financial constraints or other reasons. The website takes contributions from the users, anybody can teach poor children near his/her area every weekend (Saturday/Sundays). This is our final project after the completion of HTML & CSS. We are three members working on this project.
